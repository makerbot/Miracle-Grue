# Miracle Grue

## Overview 
This project is the basis for a new toolpathing engine to supplement skeinforge in the MakerBot/3D printer community.  The engine is C++ based.

# Layout

This project is laid out in the following directory tree (roughly)

 - documentation/ Documentation
 - configs/ Eclipse project, personal stuff
 - src/  Source Code for the project MiracleGrue
	- json-cpp/ library to read/write JSON text files (configuration)
	- mgl/ the Miracle-Grue library
	- morphogen.cc the main file
	- unit_tests/ various test programs (using cppunit)
 - inputs/ Some stl input files for demo
 - test_cases/ unit test input and output files
 - site_scons build files for qt
 - submodule/  
	- EzCppLog/ 
	- json-cpp/ 
	- libthing/ 
	- optionparser/ 
	- toolpathviz/ 

** miracle.config ** 
This is the default configuration file for Miracle-Grue. It contains information like the layer height, the nb of shells, and the infill pattern. 
When miracle-grue executes, it looks for a 'miracle.config' in the current directory, unless -c is used to specify a different config file.

** SConstruct **
This file contains instructions to build the project. It is the Makefile equivalent for the scons tool.

** Building.md **
This file contains a guide to install the tools on various platforms and compile the code (using scons instead of makefiles).
Please read Building.md to get your hacking started.

** Running Miracle-Grue **
There are are few programs generated by the build:

*** bin/miracle-grue ***

this is the skein engine. It needs a config file (-c option) and a 3D model file

Usage: miracle-grue [OPTION] [FILE]

example: bin/miracle-grue c=my_print.config inputs/3D_Knot.stl

Options:
	c=[configuration file name](default looks for miracle.config in the current directory)
	f=[first layer height]
	l=[layer height]
	w=[layer width]
	t=[space between infill 'tubes']
	s=[angle between slices for infill]

*** tests/xxxUnitTest ***

the tests directory contains unit test programs. The generated output for these tests is sent to the test_case directory.
